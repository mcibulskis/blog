with modern ides, is there really a place for checkstyle anymore/things are easily reformatted by a simple command within ides, so is there really any reason that things like extraneous spaces, spaces before or after symbols, etc should be flagged as checkstyle errors/ &nbsp;one could argue that terribly offensive code should be flagged and never checked into the code repository, and i would agree with that. &nbsp;however, it should be their pair partner who should be preventing them from doing that, or failing that, their other team members. &nbsp;any kind of major readibility issues with code should be a team or pairing patner action. &nbsp;if the team cannot or is not willing to take responsibility for the readability of their code, then the team has much larger issues, which will surface as code maintainability problems, loss of velocity as stories revisit previously written code to enhance functionality, and likelihood of errors in test cases and production code.
