The things I have found the pairing interviews best for are evaluating a candidate's (not necessarily in this order):<br /> - critical thinking skills as they talk out loud (to their pair partner), analyzing the strengths/weaknesses of different potential solutions to the next part of the exercise and justifying their preferences<br /> - problem solving skills as they talk out loud (to their pair partner), proposing different alternatives to the next part of the exercise<br /> - programming proficiency and familiarity with IDEs.  Some people can respond to questions with textbook answers, but cannot program their way out of a box.  I find pairing with them many times more useful than technical interviews.  I feel it provides me with a much more grounded and realistic view of their proficiency with a language and an IDE.<br /> - pairing personality.  Will you want to pair with this person on a daily basis?  If not, then that is probably saying something.  A candidate should be eager and enthusiastic about learning new skills, defending their ideas, and trying alternative solutions.  They should be able to communicate their thoughts clearly to their pair partners.  They should be open and receptive to constructive criticism and new ideas. They should have a generally positive and agreeable personality.  In short, they should have personality traits that show they are easy to get along with and will help you (as their pairing partner) be more productive (as a pair).  Different candidates will bring wildly different things to the table in this last regard, so, yes, this is a judgment call.<br />  - attentiveness to providing value for the business and well-crafted solutions.  It is important that developers always remain aware of the needs of the business and try our best to always deliver the most value to the business as we can.  It is next to impossible to gauge this in a candidate from conversation alone, because the candidate could be simply saying what they think you want to hear.  But, by working through an exercise with them that lends itself to having a product owner with prioritized features, you can SEE what they actually DO by instinct, regardless of what they SAY they would do.  (If you can't tell, this is something I feel quite strongly about. :P )<br /><br />With that in mind, there are several things that I feel it is critical that the interviewer do in a pairing interview:<br /> - be a good pair partner.  You will need to be supportive (provide constructive criticism, provide suggestions for alternatives, reinforce good behavior, etc), critical (challenge some of their ideas, implementations, etc), and flexible (able to adapt to the candidate's needs).  <br /> - be the best teacher that you can be.  Not all candidates will have ever done TDD or pair programming before.  They may still be excellent candidates, however, if they show an aptitude for picking up the skills quickly.  Some of the best candidates will be those who are apt learners (and excellent teachers as well), regardless of whether they are well versed and practiced in TDD and pairing.<br /> - be mindful that this is still an interview.  The pairing that you do in the interview will not be true pairing like you would do everyday.  You will be purposely holding back some suggestions to see if the candidate also thinks of them.  You will be offering up some awful ideas to see what he candidate does and says in reaction to them.  You will be purposely letting the candidate do the vast majority of he driving.  You are evaluating them.  The candidate will always be conscious of this and it is critical that you as the interviewer also always be aware of it.  Keep it in mind when you say things, because that will always be the light through which the candidate will be interpreting it.<br /><br />Some other things I have found useful:<br /> - I have found that a 2 hour pairing interview seems to work best (for me).<br />    - That provides me with 15-20 minutes at the beginning to get a quick gauge of the candidate's familiarity with TDD and pairing, do a quick overview of how the interview will progress, and answer any initial questions they may have.  If they have never done TDD or pairing before, I also use this time to give a brief explanation of what they are and why we would want to do them.<br />     - I then typically take about an hour and a half for the actual pairing exercise.  If it is just the candidate and I, then I am playing a dual role of product owner and pairing partner (really triple, if you count the interviewer role).  If there are two interviewers (I have only done this once with Nate), then one person is the pairing partner and the other the product owner.<br />          - I try to choose an exercise that has more complexity to it and fits well to something that a product owner could drop hints as to what is more/less valuable to them in terms of the features that could be worked on.  My favorite (the one I have been constantly using) is a baby sitting service payment calculator being developed for the owner of the baby sitting service.  There are three time periods with different pay rates and the afternoon and late night periods have "overlapping" hours (when written with a 12hr clock).  The problem can be made as complex or as easy as you want (I will typically adjust it some, based on the expected expertise level of the candidate).  I find that typically using whole hour increments for pay, most candidates will get to either the midnight hour change or the "overlap" in hours (forcing a switch to a 24hr clock if they started with a 12 hr clock).  I typically tell them that there is a difference between how much business I have in each of the time periods (equating to more/less business value for me if certain periods are supported), etc.  If the candidate is receptive to it, it will drive them in a particular direction for deciding which features to implement first and which to ignore until later.  If they are not asking e product owner for clarification or explicit prioritization based on business value, I will tend to prod them toward doing that.  If they still do not catch on, I will then interrupt the session for a teaching moment.  Similarly, if they are having issues getting the hang of TDD or pairing, I will interrupt the interview for a teaching moment.<br />    - the last 15-20 minutes is used for a short retrospective (from both the candidate and myself) and to answer any questions they might have.<br /> - if the pairing interview is shorter, I try to leave as much time as possible for the actual pairing and reduce the amount of teaching, in order to maximize the evaluation time. The bad part about doing that is the parts that get cut are all extremely valuable in evaluating the candidate's fit for the position, organization, and team.  This leaves me with a larger margin of error when forming my recommendation after the interview.<br />  <br />IMHO, if there haven't been any teachable moments (either you teaching the candidate or the candidate teaching you), then the interview didn't live up to its potential.  The interview should leave the candidate extremely excited about the prospect of joining the organization and working with you and your coworkers.  Teachable moments are absolutely huge ways to build that excitement.  What better way to help your organization stand out than by demonstrating in an _interview_ that your organization is so dedicated to helping developers improve their craft that teaching comes so naturally as to happen even during interviews!  Compare that to every other organization out there that is only doing their boring evaluation of all their candidates and candidates are expected to simply regurgitate the same information over and over.  Remember that in an interview, not only are you evaluating the candidate, but the candidate is also evaluating you and your organization.<br /><br />======================<br /><br />I just noticed that the pairing interview is scheduled for an hour.  When I do pairing interviews for Pillar, I insist on two hour sessions, because I feel that it gives sufficient time to get a good feel for the candidate's abilities.  Less than that and the candidate typically has not completed enough of the exercise to have gotten to the more challenging portions.  It also takes away from the conversational aspect (discussion about proposed solutions, a critical part of pairing!) of the interview and ends up feeling extremely rushed for both the interviewer and candidate. <br /><br />Moreover, it passes up on a chance to further sell the people and organization to the candidate.  By removing the time for discussions, you aren't giving the candidates a chance to really see the quality of people you have working for you.  As a developer, one of the things I really look for in an organization is whether I will be surrounded by people that I will be able to learn from and who are interested in teaching what they know.  A candidate cannot get this from a tech screen or typical interview well, because it happens while you are working on the code when the interviewer or candidate does or says something that leads to a teachable moment.<br /><br />I guess what brought this up is the huge difference I saw in the two interviews I did yesterday.  The one that the Gap asked me to do in the afternoon was scheduled for an hour and ran slightly over by 15 minutes.  It felt extremely rushed, and I felt like I had to really constrain the discussions we had to try to get farther in the exercise.  In the end, we didn't get very far in the exercise, though we did talk through a couple approaches.  I attempted to instigate one teachable moment, but it ended up feeling more like preaching than teaching, because it had to be too forced.  If we would have had two hours, I am not sure I would have felt much better than luke-warm about him, but I believe the interview would have had a completely different feeling to it and I think the candidate would have left the interview feeling more excited about and interested in the Gap.<br /><br />In the evening, I did a remote pairing interview for Pillar.  It was the first time I had done a remote pairing interview (I usually insist on face to face, because I have an easier time understanding the candidates), but it still went relatively smoothly, with only a couple technical glitches.  The difference was night and day.  The interview was filled with teachable moments and thoughtful discussions about approaches to problems, ways of testing, and programming practices.  Both the candidate and I left the interview excited and extremely glad for having gotten the chance to pair with each other, and the candidate seemed extremely interested (much more than at the start of the interview) in having a chance to sign on with Pillar.  Had the interview been constrained to an hour, it probably would not have gone anywhere near as well.<br /><br />Not all the pairing interviews I do for Pillar turn out that way.  There are plenty of candidates that do not leave me excited about their abilities or having paired with them.  But there are always teachable moments and the candidates leave the pairing interview feeling like they have experienced something completely different.<br /><br />
