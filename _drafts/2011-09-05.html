<span style="font-size: large;">Management of Project Scope</span><br /><div style="color: red;"><b><i><br /></i></b></div><b style="color: red;"><i>NOTE:&nbsp; This needs to be revised and updated to include a more accurate graph (even if it retains the old one) for a more realistic picture that will make the simplified graph make more sense.</i></b><br /><br />Regardless of which development method you use, any changes to the scope of the project must be managed in order for the project to remain on budget.&nbsp; This means that if new features are added or a redesign is performed, the product owners must be willing to remove some lower priority features that were originally within the scope of the project.&nbsp; Just because Agile Development is more open to and flexible in handling changes that arise does not mean that changes will not affect the project budget and timeline negatively.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DWiV7vJWjJs/TkSFgGjlXjI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/TOOYgwfXykE/s1600/ValueVsTime.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

When deciding upon the initial scope of a project or when adjusting the scope of a project (due to scope creep, increased cost, etc.) while the project is underway, it is critical to keep several key relationships and ideas in mind.<br /><br />The key ideas may seem obvious, but it is surprising how easily it is to either forget or neglect to take them into consideration when presented with the sparkling features of a shiny, new system that is to be developed:<br /><ol><li>Make sure the scope is limited enough that the expected ROI exceeds the cost by a considerable margin.&nbsp; Cost overruns will happen.&nbsp; Nobody wants them to happen, nobody tries to make them happen, and everybody tries to prevent it from happening, but it can still happen.&nbsp; If you ensure that there is a large difference between the total development cost and the expected ROI, you will be much more likely to come out ahead in the end.</li><li>Make sure the scope does not include features that provide little-to-no value.&nbsp; This seems like a no-brainer, but the features that provide the least value are often among those that sparkle the most.&nbsp; Do not be tempted to think that a feature is valuable based on its sparkle factor.&nbsp; An alternate feature that sparkles less and is less expensive to implement, but is as effective or almost as effective, is the better feature to include in the scope.</li><li>A good rule-of-thumb for deciding whether a feature is worth implementing is whether the cost associated with implementing the feature is greater than its expected ROI.&nbsp; This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is a reasonable guideline.&nbsp; If a feature costs more to implement than you expect to gain from its ROI, then you will never recover the cost of implementing that feature.&nbsp; This does not mean that you can never have such features within the scope of a project, but it does mean that you should keep in mind that those features only decrease your total expected ROI -- they will never add to it.&nbsp; In other words, you should generally have a really good reason for including them within the scope of the project.</li></ol><br />A brief description of some of the key relationships:<br /><ol><li>Point B is where the expected cumulative cost of the project exceeds the expected ROI of a feature.&nbsp; This is sometimes incorrectly used as a guideline for whether a feature should be included in the scope of a project.&nbsp; While limiting the project scope to all features between A and B will pretty well ensure that you will see a large ROI on the project, it is also potentially stopping the project too early and limiting the potential ROI that could be realized from the project.</li><li>The distance between D and E is the expected net ROI from the project, assuming D is the stopping point of the scope of the project.&nbsp; More generally, the distance between the cumulative team cost and the cumulative expected ROI at any given point in time is the expected net ROI from the project if it were ended at that point in time.</li><li>Point C is where the expected ROI of a feature is the same as the cost of implementing that feature.&nbsp; This is the crossing point mentioned in #3 in the key ideas list above.</li><li>Point F is the point at which you are almost guaranteed to never see a net ROI on the project.&nbsp; It has cost you just as much to finish the project as you expected to gain as a ROI over the lifetime of the project.&nbsp; While there may be an occasional project that will require you to allow a project to continue to (or beyond) point F, if you get to point F, that generally means that the project continued well beyond the point at which it should have been ended.</li><li>Generally, you will want to stop a project somewhere between E and F (the closer to E the better).&nbsp; It is around here that the expected ROI curve typically starts leveling out, which means that continued development is getting you little-to-no additional expected ROI and is quickly decreasing your net expected ROI.</li></ol><br />So, how does agile help the business manage project scope better?&nbsp; Re-prioritization of features is done every iteration.&nbsp; Iterations can be as short as a few days or as long as a couple of weeks, which means you are ensuring that your developers are always working on what is most important to the business right now, in-step with the changing needs of the business.<br /><br />Agile Development not only welcomes this re-prioritization, but demands it.&nbsp; Getting more value to the product owner faster is one of the central ideas behind Agile and frequent re-prioritization of features is core to doing this successfully.<br /><br />The adjustment of scope is handled well with Agile because production-ready versions are delivered frequently.&nbsp; This means that not only was the development team always only working on the highest value features, but they were adding them to a version of the system that was already being used.<br /><br />In Waterfall, the entire scope of the project is often worked in parallel (as much as possible) to complete the project as quickly as possible with little to no attention paid to ensuring that a production-ready system can be delivered at any time.&nbsp; Moreover, Waterfall may have spent considerable resources on less valuable features that a scope adjustment would have liked to have removed from the scope, because Waterfall does not regularly re-prioritize features to adjust to the ever-changing needs of the business.&nbsp; This is usually because the development team is not in frequent contact with the business, which means that there is a complete lack of knowledge of which features are the highest priority for the business "right now".<br /><br />
