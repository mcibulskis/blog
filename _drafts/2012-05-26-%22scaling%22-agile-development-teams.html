I imagine there is not much new in this post (if anything) that someone has not said before. &nbsp;I know that the first part (<i>Keeping Teams Together</i>) has been said by countless coaches to their teams. &nbsp;However, I am not sure that the second, very much related, part of what I'll be talking about (<i>Putting Together a Project Development Pipeline</i>) is talked about much at all, though I think it is critical to the continuing success of an Agile IT department.<br /><br />The typical way business thinks about departments and employees are as resources that need to be staffed. &nbsp;When they experience a spike in work that needs to be done, they hire additional resources. &nbsp;When they experience a decrease in the work that needs to be done, they let some resources go.<br /><br />Business should start thinking about staffing -- at least the staffing of Agile teams -- differently.<br /><br /><h2>    Keeping Teams Together</h2>Agile teams are just that -- teams. &nbsp;It remains a mystery to me why most businesses insist on continuing to think of team members as easily and cheaply inter-changeable, because they are not.<br /><br />Agile team members do not fit the typical way that business thinks about resources within departments. &nbsp;They are not operating independently of each other and simply reporting to their manager for instructions. &nbsp;They are not simply a grouping of individual employees with varying skill sets and experience that correspond to some perceived "ideal" team composition. &nbsp;They are not replaceable parts manufactured in university classrooms to the same specifications.<br /><div><br />It takes time for teams to adapt to the addition of new members and the loss of existing members. &nbsp;It's important to understand that Agile teams really do begin to function very much like sports teams do. &nbsp;Team members begin to anticipate and rely upon others to behave in certain ways, based on past experiences, to be able to rely on them for knowledge on particular subjects, and to feel safe bouncing ideas off of them without fear of judgment. &nbsp;When a member is added/removed from the team, it takes the team a significant amount of time to find a new balance. &nbsp;During that "re-balancing" period, the team will not be performing at the same level that they were before -- yes, I am saying that even when a new member is added, you can expect that the velocity of the team will drop until the team integrates the new member into the team.<br /><br />That is not to say that you should never move people between teams; a little bit of change is good, as it injects some new ideas, practices, and knowledge into the team and allows some of the ideas, practices, and knowledge to be transferred to other teams. &nbsp;But, this should not be done at critical times within a project, unless a team is having severe issues and believe that they need restructuring of their team. &nbsp;Note that I said that it was up to the team to decide whether their issues were severe enough to warrant a restructuring during a critical time period for the project.</div><br />Some businesses already practice rotating members between teams, but I am going to suggest going so far as to allow the teams to decide amongst themselves when member rotation should occur, how many member should rotate, and which members should rotate to which teams, as opposed to having it dictated by management.<br /><br /><br /><h2>    Putting Together a Project Development Pipeline</h2><br />We encourage Agile team members to have collective ownership of the project they are working on. &nbsp;We should also encourage the teams to have collective ownership of the entire project development pipeline.<br /><div><br /></div><br /><br /><h2>    <span style="color: red;">NOTES</span></h2><br /><br /><br /><br />Originally, I was going to use a manufacturing equipment metaphor to try to help relate how I feel business should be thinking about using Agile teams. &nbsp;While I liked how it worked for relating how they should be approaching determining how many permanent teams they wanted to keep on hand, I decidedly did not like the implication that team members were replaceable parts that were all created to certain tolerances and could be swapped in and out inter-changeably. &nbsp;Because team members most certainly are NOT easily or cheaply inter-changeable.<br /><br /><br />--- Fall back on sports team metaphor for more than the sum of its individuals, takes time to gel as a team, etc. &nbsp;But then also use manufacturing metaphor for relating to permanent teams, filling pipeline, not overstaffing/understaffing. &nbsp;Combination of the two for justification as to why it's cheaper to keep a core set of teams than to repeatedly build-up and then tear-down.<br /><br />- Think of teams as processors<br />- Bring the work to the processors (teams)<br />- Don't try to tear apart processors and rebuild them (don't pull team members out of teams and try to put them on different teams)<br />- Keep high functioning teams together, don't steal from them.<br />- If the organization thinks they need to scale, they should demonstrate that there is adequate product (project) backlog to keep all processors (teams) working<br />- So how do you know how many teams to permanently have?<br />- What throughput level does the business want to commit to?<br />-- How much work is there in the project backlog now?<br />-- How much work does the business anticipate in the future?<br />- Don't overbuild teams (either via overstaffing teams or by creating too many teams) to burn through the current backlog and then have to disband them<br />- Not the same as buying machinery, but it shares some similarity<br />-- If you have to build x parts right now and have a foreseeable continued demand of y parts/month, then you will purchase the machinery to support that anticipated continued demand. &nbsp;You won't purchase machinery that will be able to create 10*y parts/month, nor would you purchase machinery that would only be able to create y/2 parts/month. &nbsp;It just doesn't make business sense to over-spend for capacity on a machine that you'll never use or to under-spend and get a machine that will not be able to meet your needs.<br />-- Similarly, the number of teams should be based on the foreseeable demand for development based on the product (project) backlog<br />-- The teams, like the machinery, are an investment. &nbsp;Not only is it hard to find highly-trained developers that will work well on your teams, but there is significant cost overhead associated with the time that it takes a team to "gel" -- the time it takes for them to really start working as a tightly-knit team as opposed to a group of loosely-coupled individuals.<br />-- It is much more expensive to try to start up new teams than to maintain a highly-functioning team and keep them productive<br />- Yes, this means that the business needs not only a project backlog, but a process in place for ensuring that new projects get added to that backlog.<br />-- Just-in-time? Like manufacturing? Keep small backlog with just enough in it to ensure that no team is ever left idle.<br />-- Just re-prioritize constantly with an extremely large backlog?<br />-- Both?<br />-- But some projects may never get done if the backlog is constantly re-prioritized! &nbsp;That is good. &nbsp;It means that even though the project has significant value to someone (or some department), it was less value to the business as a whole than the other projects that were in the backlog.<br /><br />
