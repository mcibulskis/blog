Inspired by talk by Todd Kaufman (sp?) at Path to Agility 2012.<br /><br />Todd talked a lot about only using metrics to answer meaningful questions. &nbsp;And said that those questions should only be about what has already happened. &nbsp;They should not be used in a predictive fashion.<br /><br />But, business has the need to make predictions and plans. &nbsp;The more accurately they can plan, the leaner they can run. &nbsp;The less accurately they can plan, the more cash they need to keep in reserve to "cover" for cost-overruns. &nbsp;So, more accurate planning means that cash that would have otherwise been kept in reserve to cover cost-overruns can instead be invested back into the company in some way so as to provide additional value for the company.<br /><br />There needs to be some sort of happy medium for using metrics in a predictive fashion. &nbsp;Todd suggested that using a team's average cycle time on stories and then using the number of stories (assuming all stories approximately equally sized and all are fairly small stories) could be used to provide rough estimates to business. &nbsp;For example, if the estimate based on cycle time and number of stories told you 7 iterations plus or minus 2 iterations for the team, then tell the business to commit to a minimum of 5 iterations with a possible extension of 4 additional iterations.<br /><br />It wasn't quite clear from his example how he got the +/- 2 iterations.<br /><br />Is that good enough for business to make accurate decisions?<br /><br />
